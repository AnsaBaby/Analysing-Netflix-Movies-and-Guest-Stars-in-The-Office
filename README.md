# Analysing-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
Python projects on DataCamp - A investigation to Netflix Movies and Guests


Apply the foundational skills in Python and Data Science courses to analyse and visualize movie and TV data.

ðŸ’¼ Description
In this projects, I applied my skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python in DataCamp to solve a real-world data science problem.I am doing an investigative study on the famous Netflix Shows to discover whether the Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office" using the python libraries Pandas and Matplotlib.

This project helped me in gaining knowledge in an essential data science skill â€” exploratory data analysis, which allows me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I create of the data.

ðŸ“º Project Details

This was a Guided Project as a part of DataCamp Data Science Training

Dig into a real-world Netflix movie dataset using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.I did the below steps to arraive in a conclusion.

1. Loading a friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
10. What next?
